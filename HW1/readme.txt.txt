3- 

a-Give 2 relations that holds the criterias of Boyce-Codd Normal Form, if there is any. Explain why they are in Boyce-Codd Normal Form, give your reasons and proofs in details. (If there isn’t any relations that satisfy the criteria of Boyce-Codd Normal Form, then just write it.)

b- Give 2 relations does not hold the criterias of Boyce-Codd Normal Form, if there is any. Explain why they are not in Boyce-Codd Normal Form, give your reasons and proofs in details. (If there isn’t any relations, then just write it.)
